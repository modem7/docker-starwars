Further notes from Mike Edwards, the author of the player script towel used:

`Replacement telnet at asciimation.mirkwood.net:23/24. Port 23 is the last released Star Wars asciimation by Simon Jensen, and port 24 is Jansen's other goofy asciimation, The death of Jar Jar Binks.`

Image is based on nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged, and all the content is local to the container.
